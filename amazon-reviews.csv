Amazon_,"The product came bad packaged, it seems like the mouse was imported in OEM form, and the box was made locally. The box itself was in shabby condition, bandaged from all possible sides.The mouse was in a plastic bag inside the box, has a few scratches in the bottom pane.Pros:1. The wireless receiver is very small, tucked inside the mouse.2. The indicator light below the mouse is completely invisible. Hence the battery time will be more. It's claimed highly in the product details, but I have to wait and see what happens.3. The mouse is very small in size. Sometimes I think it's going to slide away. Perfect for travelling.4. Auto sensor to switch off. Starts working/wakes almost instantly once you move the mouse.5. No separate software / configuration required.6. Good amount of instructions to locate the wireless dongle embedded inside the mouse.7. Single battery operation, making it light weight. Battery comes with the mouse and a pullout tag.8. Price is competitive.9. Good build quality.Cons:1. A little small in size, sometimes it felt the mouse is going to slide away. But then again it might be because of using bugger mouse in past.2. Bad packaging. This is one point which I really disliked about the product. Hence removal of 1 star.I started writing this review with a rating of 2 stars because I was really annoyed to see the packing in which it arrived. But eventually after going over the pros and cons, I decided it's worth it to give at least 4 stars.A definitely buy product, competitively priced."
Himanshu,• delivery is fast but packaging is average• build quality of mouse is good and it comes with battery too• main advantage of this mouse is lightless (red light) optical which makes it better then other.
Peaches,"I am using it for six month continuously(finished the battery which was provided in three months only) and haven't faced any issues. However when I went to logitech site to register the product, it wasn't there in list, it is old model and that may be the reason, not sure how to the support will be in case of any issues"
TechBuff,"This was beyond my expectation that within 6 months this mouse will give up its functionalities - that too when the product is from Logitech. Let me sum it up for you:Good:- Light weight- Easy to hold- Looks & feels slimBad:- The scrolling mechanism failed within 4-5 months (its 6 months running & I am UNABLE to use the scrolling wheel any longer - as it behaves on its own mind)Conclusion:- At this price there are other brands available - which will work flawlessly for >6 months at least.- And if you need peace of mind, rather add a few extra bucks and buy the higher models (which are proven over time)- This won't be a wise purchase as it seems more like a hit or miss case. Why take that chance?"
Melvin,"My personal experience with this mouse is just amazing. Before buying it, i was not user if this mouse will perform as i expected but after using it Just enjoy using it.Look and in hand experience is amazing, u will feel good while handling itI bought this mouse because i was fed-up with wires and as this is wireless i made my plan of buying it and i must say that i had no problem with the connectivity, i can say that it has a connectivity range of more then 10 m.It also has Invisible optics which is Great and it is very durable enough, i have dropped it many times and nothing happened.If you liked the review kindly tap the ""Helpful"" button"
Pratik More,"I was using Logitech M235 for almost 2 years now, but all of a sudden pores/swells/lumps filled with oily liquid started to appear on its rubber part of the body where fingers were getting in contact with it. So being fear full of it being something like carcinogenic, I had to just change the mouse.After doing some searched I narrowed down on this one, since it doesn't seem to have rubbery body and is of plastic, so it probably won't suffer the same fate.Now to the product itself, I'll compare it with M235 quite often as I have used it for 2 years and it is in same price.1. It is larger than M235, just little but I actually appreciate it as it is much better to handle in slightly thicker hands.2. It is very smooth operating, I've used it on wooden rest as well as floor and it works quite well, almost better than M235 as I was using it for 2 years3. On off button is very convenient to use as its design is better than M2354. It is aesthetically way more appealing tan M2355. Plug and play, I used it on both Linux and Windows and it doesn't require anything other than simply putting the USB thing in USB slot, mouse starts working ASAPCons1. It is retaining some oily fingers, should be easy to clean but  still I found it more likely to get dirtier than M235 due to black body2. No light to indicate battery status, could be both +ve and -ve, but I would rather have it than not3. Packaging was very bad, that box came in almost crushed, but my product was okay so I didn't complain but it wont happen all the timeOverall it is wonderful mouse for Rs 499/-Would recommend, I can't yet comment on battery life as it is still early, but hopefully it will last for some time.Regards"
Jigar Shah,"Got it for ₹450/- in lighting deal and reviewing it after 3 months of use.PROS:Mouse is very good in terms of build quality and also connects very fast to any computer (even if you use it in office where USB ports are disabled).Both Left and Right clicks work fine and click wheel is perfectly balanced in scrolling. Wheel also have matt and rough finish for better grip and having clicky feel while scrolling which enables user to get precisely right scroll.It only needs only one regular size cell and having one out of the box. which is good.CONS:The only con i found is that the mouse feels little small in size if you have average to big palms and especially if you are using HP or Dell regular wired ones, you might need some time to adjust your grip. I personally had strains for first 2-3 days then i got used to it.Haven't tested it for Gaming Yet. (as i don't do gaming that much on PC)if you find this review helpful then please hit the Helpful Button below. Thanks."
Pravin Vibhute,"Update::Don't buy. The scroll wheel not working in just 3 months.  No way to return.Very comfortable to use for everyone.Build quality is great.Battery life also very good.Long life, good quality, comfortable for use.👌👌👍👍"
Aswini,Don't think much its best in its class.Got it @ ₹425 only. The same model would cost around ₹750 in flipkart. Package containing --AA BATTERY-UNIFIED USB 2.0 RECIVER-MOUSEUploaded pics which will help to get idea about it's size.
Rísháßh Kúmàr,Just got this mouse today....first thought why to spend 600 bucks for a wireless mouse while I can get many other options for cheaper prize but then thought to have it a try and these are the following observations1) It's quite handy and small in size with makes it convenient to use.2) Just plug the Bluetooth device and you're good to go nothing much to do.3) Comes with pre-installed battery.4) No light indicator.5) Gives a premium feel while holding.6) faster response.
Vivek,I received a used product. It had scruff marks all over the bottom of the mouse. The packet was open inside the Amazon pouch. Shocking to say the least
PraveenKumar S,"I previously used logitech M150, i used heavily for gaming and left click button started giving me issues... i taught of buying wired mouse but i am used to wireless now and not ready to go backwards hence brought this...Pros: Compact easy to use, single AA battery and good range. Cons: Compact size :-)"
Alavala Reddy,Pls don’t buy this Mouse.. I am facing many problems with Scroll Bar(Middle Ball).. it is not working properly at allCheck in Logitech support.. many of them are struggling with the same issue.. but simply they are telling.... just change laptop settingsFrom past 2 weeks I am following with customer support.. till now no one had given reply..
PV,"I received this product on 3rd March 2017, and few days back found that it is not working.Tried to contact amazon call center but as they say they are available 24/7 but you cannot contact them, tried to contact logitech customer care but their numbers are unreachable.Donno where i should contact as the product warranty is of 1 year, please respond amazon people."
Devesh Revankar,"Pros:1. Compact and lightweight, so ideal for someone who is constantly moving around2. Invisible optic, and hence no red light below the mouse3. Boasts a 1-year battery life (yet to test it though)4. AmbidextrousCons:1. Small, so if you have big hands, stay away2. Loud click sound3. Scroll wheel click a little too hardWill update after having used it for a while."
Pranshul,"If you have a laptop then its a must buy especially in this work from home period. Its been 6 months since i have been at home and working all this time with just my laptop with the help of touchpad only which started turning out, very irritating at times. Mouse has a different touch and feel so, i am glad i bought it.About the mouse, its light, its smooth, its fast ( even managing with my slow laptop very well) its clicky and the wheel is smooth same as the glide, also the optical senson is already very good and works on all surfaces (atleast for me) with high precision so dont rush for kouse with higher dpi etc. Its every thing a mouse should be except the fact that its not thatt stylish as it looks in the pictures but its cool enough at this price.I strongly feel, it should cost around 550 not more than that but its 650 (as of now)."
Harsh Prabhu,Good product if u can get it for 599 or less. It is durable for the cost I paid (Rs. 599) it is too small to hold for medium straight hands and too narrow to hold for wide but small hands. The clicks make noise and not suitable for quite environment. It is good mouse if u need a wireless mouse and if you are clumsy and don’t want to spend too much on a mouse. If you are ready to spend more (apx. Rs.1300 total) try Logitech M331. It is a great mouse perfect fit and zero moise
Amazon Customer,"After completion of a year, the scroll has stopped working. I just love it. Compact size, easy to handle. Love the design. Small and easy to handle, comfortable.Thanks to amazon, I got this product at 550/- in a deal. Using it since 3+ months. Love to use this mouse instead of my lappy's. And thanks to the Amazon prime to deliver me this product within 2 days. Amazon never disappointing me on it's services. Faster services than all other online shopping sites, Customer oriented company, products at best value.I love amazon and the product."
Sujin S Mathew,"This mouse is the most comfortable one yet. I have used so many other devices, but none were so comfortable compared to this. Logitech just makes great quality mouse.Great for comfort, easy connect to device, works best. So far no complaints.I wouldn't say the same for the packaging, seems a bit roughly handled. But overall no damage to the product and that is what matters.If you are gaming on this mouse. Then go for it. It has no fancy RGB but who is asking. Just a great mouse!!!!"
atin,"I have used mostly Logitech mouses in my 7 years of carrier as a Design Engineer. But this product was not as per expectation. Within 3 months of purchase, it's left button started having issues. I got it replaced, though, from service center. Now again after use 6-7 months middle wheel is not working at all. Will need to get replaced again from service center, as its warranty period is not over.But I don't expect such products from Logitech or maybe, it's not designed for 3D modelers or designers who use it for 3D softwares."
K. HILL,"I have been buying similar Logitech mice for decades. They generally last through many years of daily use. This one was chosen for several features: One battery not two; compact and lightweight for travel; and interior pocket to hold the bluetooth sender when not in use; comfortable and natural fit in my hand.  From time to time the lens must be cleaned, and it helps to blow off dust and cat hair now and then. Otherwise, totally trouble-free. Good responsiveness and speed. I am not a gamer so I can't evaluate that, but for desktop publishing on an iMac it works fine."
virtual,"Mouse is comfortable, light, medium sized and smooth to run. Scroll is OK and nice grip groooves around mouse. But packing and few scratch bottom contact surface of mouse hints at used it returned item. Also box says logitech 2018 and big sticker on back side of box says imported in 2020, which seems a big lie as logitech do not make it anymore. I would had return this but I really need a mouse now. Appario retail is lier and in recent times I've returned it item two times. Now I don't have trust in amazon anymore."
Vince,"Pros:1. Ergonomic design (Compact and Comfortable)2. Nice grip3. Nice material used4. Self Contained DesignCons:1. Doesn't have Unifying Receiver (Due to lack of this kind of review I bought it accidentally, sellers are also lying in questions asked about it, so if you want unifying receiver please don't purchase it)2. It has only 1 year warranty because there are other mouses with 3 year warranty also."
Bharatraj,"Mouse is working as per expectations. The only weird thing is that sometimes it behaves in its own way. Without moving the mouse it selects many items, cursor moves in its own way. So it is useless if you pay for brand like LOGITECH.Don't buy online if possible. Also as per many reviews, serial no on the box and product do not match."
Jay,"Working as expected minimum. Its standard wireless mouse.PROSPlug and play with no manual configuration needed at all.Good part is its get detected within 3sec of starting/switching on button.CONSMay not be concern, but when it says three button mouse, I was expecting that scroll button/roll can be used apart from scrolling.I had Microsoft wired 3 button mouse (same as this) and its Scroll button (apart from standard scrolling function), if kept pressed, I could scroll files all 4 directions, simply moving my mouse. Whereas this doesn't work that way. I've to hold the bar of file and scroll/pull manually to see large file contents."
Arun Sharma,"Hello Everyone.I am usually lazy when it comes to writing reviews on Amazon about specific products. But I had to write reviews about this crap mouse so that other buyers don't feel cheated after buying it. No doubt, that this product is lucrative due to being so cheap for a wireless mouse from a renowned company like Logitech, but it does not even worth the 450 bucks I paid for it.The left and right buttons are fine to press. But the middle button, if you want to press it, you will need to apply the force of an alligator's jaw.I returned the first mouse thinking that it might be defective. However, the return I got had the same problem which made me sure that all items in this series have defective ""middle buttons"".Another con I found that it is so small. Good for kids, but if you are an adult, you will feel like that it doesn't fit in your palm. And after some time, your palm will start to ache.This is an honest review fella. Please save your precious bucks and don't buy this product."
Deepak Nanjundaiah,"A sub 500 mice from someone like Logitech is always a welcome and interesting. Feels good in hand, the buttons are tactile with minimal click noise. Scroll wheel is a lot more quieter on the other hand which is impressive. These are just first impressions, will keep this updated/posted should I find something worthy to highlight here.Verdict: Overall a nice product and recommend it considering it's price point."
Akhilesh H,"Purchased in 2018. Definitely not for gamers. Buy a wired one for gaming. It's too sensitive that my spray control got worse in CS GO ( also slight lag ). It looks good, has a good battery out of the box. It's sensitive for basic uses ( if you use a mousepad ). It's not easy for small hands. The design of edges in the back is kinda uncomfortable on long usage.If you want to game, Get 800 DPI mouse. Also I kinda dropped it lately. The middle mouse is kinda bad now.The software from logitech is minimal, you can't see the battery stats or assign another USB module, You need a unifying module for that."
Prime Member,"The product is durable and effective in using with the laptops...Moves with ease and USB responder is quite effective...The mouse do not have a light underneath and comes along with a AA battery, with 1 yr manufacturer warranty. Also carry on/off option for saving energy..Overall it's good purchase and fits really well for small hands... Bigger palms need lil extra size to get proper hold."
Anoop,"This was a frantic purchase to be honest here. The times are not that good to buy/test any random product online. The only reason for me to go ahead with this product blindly was my faith in Logitech as a brand and the price point of course. Have been using a lot of Logitech products since my college days and they are really reliable.Anyway, based on aforementioned trust, I bought it for my work from home setup. And yet again Logitech didn't break that trust. It's a good/decent mouse ergonomically (especially if you're using it for office work) and daily normal usage. Your hand wouldn't feel fatigued or cramped up, even after using it for hours. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming purposes for obvious reasons.P. S - My suggestion always for devicss that run on batteries are, please use Duracell, if you really want to use these devices to their full potential."
Ether,The Scroll is terrible... every time i scroll down it scrolls up to some distance and then down... bad design.... I didn't expect this from logitech of all the brands... mouse and keyboards are their primary products... consider some other brand like microsoft... this one is terrible
Rohith,"Using this with my office laptopvery compact and perfect designUsing since a week and palm doesnt hurtCant comment on battery, yet on the same batteryjust plug and play, no configuration requiredpairs instantly when mouse is turned ON, no lag or delayGood sensor and it has a perfect traction."
P. Banerjee,"Basically this mouse is not that much good for gaming. Although it's so good to use for any official work or any other work in your laptop. It's bluetooth connection is really amazing. You don't need to reconnect it every time after turn on the laptop. However, I'm happy with it. Thank you Amazon to deliver this in right time. Well, if my recommendation is the concern so far then I must say, people who're looking for a light weight, hassle free & wireless mouse, can go for it without having any second thought."
Emil Abraham,The first battery which came with the mouse only lasted a month later I purchased a normal double a batterie and it runs for couple of months now. Average product. Maximum distance with good Bluetooth connectivity is 5 feet after that  upto 10 feet we get connectivity but with very little accuracy. Value for money product. Hope this helps. All the best.
swapnil,"Logitech B-170 is a great addition to your workstation.Its small built makes it ideal for portability and design is good enough for everyday use.I have been using it for almost a month now and no complaints.Works on almost all surfaces, though i would highly recommend using a dedicated mousepad for long lasting smoothness.Clicks and scroll wheel is satisfying enough. Although the scroll can get tedious sometimes.Ideal foe everyday use but if you are looking for something dedicated for gaming then a high end model would be better.It works fine for games but lacks the precision and addedd controls.Overall a value addition to the work from home arsenal"
Anil Bijlani,I had earlier purchased m235 which I am using since last four years. For my second laptop this time I purchased B 170 instead since it was Rs150 cheaper. I do not find any difference in performance. This one doesn't have led indicator beyond that everything is same. Incidentally its imported from Hongkong but is of Chinese make.
Yash,"This just feels like any other wireless mouse in that price range.The ergonomics are better than most of the other wireless mice under 1K.....So a good deal but it is back-heavy just as any other logi wireless mouse....That's not a big issue though.The only issue is, there is no LED to notify that the mouse is switched on....Decent deal for normal PC work though......"
Sanjiv,"Buying same model 3rd time in 18 months for 3 different machines at home for self n family.Simple, Long lasting and reliable mouse.Not a fancy one..works consistency, no lag,no red/infra lights,works directly on transparent glass table without mouse pad.Not for gamingNo DPI adjustmentBattery life descent"
Amazon Customer,"There are click noises but the scroll button is completely noiseless. I found a few scratches on the bottom but since there were no technical issues I did not return n it. It's been a month since i bought it & it's working fine. Easy to use & comfortable for an average size hand.Great for daily use. Pointer speed is fast.Note: The left and right clicks are interchanged, download the software 'LogiOptions' for setting the clicks to normal. You're welcome."
Jithin Kuruvilla,The mouse is good and easy to use .... But i think i got a refurbished item as there was no seal in the battery and the mouse was ON inside the box along with the battery..... So i don't trust Amazon anymore..... This thing has been repeating to many times now.... Flipkart is better in trust..... Selling used/returned as new products or fraud......
Harsh  s navale,I felt like I was holding a toy but that's kinda ok.The sensor is far from my expectations.Its sometimes Unresponsive in gaming. (Clicks don't work. I play Rockrt league and sometimes the double click doest work and I fail to flip.)(Don't ever buy this if u want to play competitive games)Scroll wheel makes noise like a 200 year old rusty machine.
Akshay Kaushik,"1-Bl 70 wireless mouse, good range.2-Supports,Windows, Mac OS, Chrome OS3-Affordable and Reliable4-And installation is just nothing, you have to take out USB receiver from the mouse and just plug it in your PC/laptop, count 1 second and it'll connect.5-12 months warranty and battery life is also good it's somewhere around 11-12 months so be assured.6-I am using it since 6 months and i haven't faced any issue so far.7-This product stands unique in the market in it's segment at such a cheap price, just love it, logitech is really a reliable brand."
Ravi,The ergonomics of mouse is good but the build quality and material is very bad. Scroll in mouse went bad in 7 months and now I am facing lags and connectivity drop many times. Would not suggest anyone to get this. Had Dell mouse earlier which lasted for 3 years until it got stolen.
Suman Paul,I am using this mouse with Windows 10 operating system. Also my computer is equipped with antivirus. I am facing difficulty to work with this mouse. It is not operating properly and mouse pointer getting stuck in the screen. I am forced to move the mouse in some other place to make it work again properly. It is not capable to operate properly on top of a burnished table. I feel I have wasted my money to purchase this mouse
Chat,"Can be used for regular work, but possibly not for gaming. The tracking ""light"" (for want of a better word) below the mouse is invisible. So, for those of you used to seeing a red light when the mouse is on, be aware. The mouse is lightweight, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it came preloaded with a battery."
Dr. Akash K. Rose,"Wireless convenience in a very lightweight and ergonomic design. The single battery makes a significant difference in weight as compared to 2-battery types.  For those who work all day on their computers, this mouse is a great blessing. The on/off switch and the invisible infrared beam help to conserve power well. Further, the optical tracking is excellent and good enough for all critical work."
Darpan,It's good at this price but doesn't feel so comfortable in holding while working for a long time.
Jacob George,"I bought this after the left click stopped working for the Logitech M185 bluetooth mouse, that I have been using for more than last 3 years or so. What I like about this mouse (B170) is that the on-off switch is easy to operate for this one compared to the prior one. But compared to M185, B170 looks a bit more wider and also grippy on the sides, which are changes I am trying to get adjusted to."
Amazon Customer,"I got this product in on Jan 2019, within 15 days it stopped working even though all the package was done properly and removed battery protection when first arrived, though my sixth sense said once to change the battery, and i did magically it worked, now all of sudden it is gone. i use regularly daily for more then 12 hours, but it is gone now.. with USB in laptop windows say it is not working fine.After all this when we try to contact Amazon will direct you to logitech non of the customer service number is working i stay in bangalore Amazon people gave me this 080-22667266 which is not at all working.. searched in google non of the number is working.. some how feels bit strange to buy  electronics goods in the shops rather then in online.."
Vaibhav,"I bought the mouse having pretty high expectations, because the reviews are so high and all, But the scroll wheel on the mouse stops working after 3-4 weeks, and now the page goes up if i scroll down, and the other way round.the bluetooth was fine until now, but recently even the pointer isnt working properly, The mouse is definitely not for gaming, and with my experience, it's not for normal purposes too.Huge let down. Buy at your own risk."
Gaurav,I rated this product 5 stars in the beginning but now I am changing it to 2 stars because the product developed hardware issues after 3 months of very light use.The scroll wheel isn't working properly now. Click button has developed issues sometimes it clicks/double clicks and sometimes it starts drag n drop itself.
Professional_Reviewer,"Its small size makes it easier to carry like putting it in a backpack or just in your pouch. It has got a nice battery backup. The advertised battery backup is 12 months but i can say the it will surely last for 10 months. The laser used is transparent probably that's what makes the battery last longer. .The dongle fits in the slot provided and there is instruction manual provided for accessing the slot. Handling it,  does feel good and it does not feel cheap mouse in any way. Logitech does not go wrong with its products. All that it lacks is a DPI switch , but is it what you need in a small mouse and after-all its not a gaming mouse."
Joe Thomas,"Its slightly on the smaller side. Its easy to carry.But might find difficult to use for some. I got used to this , so i am really comfortable with it.The first product i recieved got defective after a few months. The warrenty is not covered by Amazon, its provided by Logitech.The greatest issue is to find a Logitech authorised service centre ( Which is a headache itself. They have really few service centres in South India). When i finally found one(travelled a lot), they said they will replace the whole thing. So , i had to wait for a replacement, which took nearly 1 week to arrive. I again had to travel all the way to their service centre to get it.The new product works just super fine. It's been almost 1& half years i had been using this."
Amazon Customer,"Was in desperate need of a new wireless mouse after my previous one stopped working. This was available at a reasonable price and Logitech has a track record of producing really good mice.Pros:1. Small and lightweight, if you're someone with large hands, this may be subjective.2. The sensor doesn't shine a light, hence, it works well at night when I don't want to disturb people around me3. Tracking, this does it very well. Clicks aren't loud, but still audible.Cons:1.  The scroll wheel feels less durable and cheap.2. Accidental clicks may occur, avoiding it takes some getting used to.3. This isn't exactly a con, but no custom DPI settings. It's definitely not a gaming mouse, so that can excuse the lack of those. A wired gaming mouse will suit you better in those cases.TLDR: A well-rounded cheap and reliable mouse. It's definitely a good purchase if you're looking for a new mouse and you're an average user"
Bratin Paul,1) It's upper surface is  not curved much so when using long times it  will discomfort you.2) given  a) mouse & bluetooth otg for connection with pc  b) one battery  c) manual  d) warranty information3) again if someone plays game  for short time 1-1.5hrs it will  not make any problem if using for nonstop 4-5hrs maybe  you can feel discomfort .4) but as it's a Logitech brand and it's renowned company so easily anyone can buy it without hesitation and I hope the product will long last .
hemant t.,"It is a very good reasonable mouse, very ergonomic product. I think it is little bit small for my hand. It is very advanced mouse has it as invisible optical sensor and work quite well from 20foots. Very light weight and good design, making it easy to hold. Custom DPI button in-mouse isn’t there, but still good for gaming. The buttons are responsive at all times (999/1000)[deducted 1 point for any possible chances]. As sensitive sensor as possible of an wired mouse."
TD,One of the best there is...easy to hold and clicks are good the best part is it's very light and comfortable.Connection is easy for Mac and windows and increases the productivity bya lot precision is top notch even the build quality seems superb.No issues with battery life and is decent for gaming at this price .....I got it for 645₹..Nice deal
gss.vishnu,"During the critical pandemic situation ordered the mouse with Speedy delivery charge of 50/-Delivery was on time, packaging was good.Initially it was working perfect , but after 2-3 months mouse scrolling is not as expected.If we use scroll button to go down, it goes up or something like that.Better to go for Logitech Wired mouse only, if you are comfortable to use WIRED mouse"
AkiMosi,"The mouse is really so small, so if you are one with big palms you may have to keep your index and middle finger bent for a while, or until you get used to it. Moving the mouse is so smooth - Thanks to the AmazonBasic Extended Mouse Pad too for that.The design is so minimalistic and the pattern at the holding provides some extra grip. When the mouse is moved horizontally quickly, we can feel the battery moving inside. The nice part of the mouse is, there is no red LED light flashing at the bottom to detect the motion, that is really cool thing.  There is an in-built space to hold the USB receiver so that we won't miss it. Finally, it is a good mouse at this price point. And the on-off button will really help us to save some battery(comes with the product)The packaging was not great so - it is an issue with the seller, not the product. I would recommend this."
Peshal,"It worked well for first 4 months and now it's not working, the scroll wheel goes two places up and one down, and does the same when I try to scroll down. So, it looks like I am going up-up-down when I try to go up. It's irritating as hell. Logitech support isn't responding to my emails or chat attempts. So, that means I can't claim the warrant as well.In other words only go for this mouse if you can't find any other better suitors which I highly doubt will be the case.Thanks"
Ganesh S.,"I'll say what I dislike about this product first- It's not good for the long term, I repeat, IT IS NOT GOOD FOR LONGTERM AT ALL!!!- Its usage life is around 3 to 6 months at max, even if you change its battery or plug the USB receiver in different USB ports it just says ""USB device not recognisable"" after 3 to 6 months (depending on how much you used)Now I'll say what I like about this product-For the price given to it. It works well. I have used for both my office work and my gaming pastime-It's just plug and play. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just plug the USB receiver and wait for it to read, after that you are good to goIt would be nice if this lasted longer really, but for its given price. I guess this is all one can get to its maximum capability."
ASWIN.P,The optical device stopped working and the cursor not moving after a use of two weeks. So decided to repair and tried unscrewing. It is easier to unscrew an a380 than this. There r no screws but plastic locks and almost impossible to figure that out. We have to search for videos of a crash course of unscrewing this. But finally we will end up in damaging the device. Yes its damaged. Never going to consider again
Alok Sharma,The product is good and working as expected. Will post a review again after few months of use if i do not forget. Overall product looks new but on the bottom it seems as if has been tried once or twice since the three protrudes on which the mouse sits has some not exactly scratches but sort of the same. But this is with both the mouses previous one and its replacement. Actually i ordered for replacement by mistake as i thought the mouse is not working. Its invisible light and i got wrong impression.
Aravindhan,"Good and cheap(price) one from Logitech.Build is sturdy, dropped several times no issues.Battery life claimed to last 1year have to check. But invisible light technology (fancy name for Infra red) hope it'll last longer than conventional led.Design is suttle and beautiful, good handling, no DPI switch. Ambidextrous."
VASANTH,I started using this only a couple of weeks ago. So far ith is good. I prefer to review after 2 months use. Presently I am working continuously 8 hours a day. So far no problem. Previously i was working with Microsoft mouse which was no good consuming battery heavily and stopped working after using a few months. So I have to review this thing after a couple of months only
Hareesh Chandran,"The mouse stopped working after 15 months. Not sure due to my usage, but the old one I had, is still working. The USB wireless adapter is now having a loose connection and I tried in different laptops without luck. The battery consumption was really low and that was what I liked with this product. However, it became useless after 15 months of daily usage."
Divyang Oza,Bought this Mouse on 4th Feb 2017 for Rs 615.While nowadays price are comparatively less.I am using this wireless mouse on daily basis for over 6 months now. Battery life is solid. The box comes with a AA Alkaline battery of nice quality.From my usage the mouse operative range is around 5-10 foot in open room. It is a laser optic which is 1000 dpi capable mouse.The clicks are good and the mouse feels quite good.
Deepta Baidwan,"I cannot believe this is Logitech. It stopped working after a month. Tried changing batteries but no chnage. Its very light, almost too light that you zoom across the screen, takes a bit of time to get used to it. Not happy at all."
Prasad Kulkarni,"The mouse was initially great and performed as expected. But after a few months, it's middle button clicking ability decreased and after a few more months, the 'click' functionality is not working. The battery-life is actually really good. Connectivity is great too! But, it is a bit small to hold and is a bid rigid and NOT smooth which is not acceptable for Gaming or Professional use. So I recommend this mouse to anyone who just does daily tasks like Surfing the Internet, watching videos, some casual gaming and for Spreadsheet/ word document Office use."
K A,"review after 2 month use , very good wireless mouse at this price,  before i buying i worry about range but after using my tension was gone its deliver perfect range , it works perfectly from 5ft away with wall but i face sometimes time lag but ok its happen very few times when i use from near to recivrr it works superb , overall very nice product at this price"
DINESH REDDY SALLA,"Bought this Wireless mouse on 10th November 2016 and its been 23 Months (1 Year 11 M) since I've been using it. Let's get into the details of the Mouse:PROS:1. Economical - Best brand at a budget price.2. Reliable - Never slows down even in the heavy tasks.3. Plug & Play - Gets seamlessly to work with multiple devices on-the-go just by switching the receiver.4. Ergonomics - this mouse was designed ergonomically to work with both the user types (Left handed and Right handed)5. Amazing battery life - I've been using the stock AA battery supplied by the manufacturer past 2 years.6. Durable - the mouse survived multiple drop downs at desk heights and it still works nice.7. Invisible Optic - this feature is cool, you cannot find any red laser beam underneath the mouse and no distractions in the low light conditions.CONS:1. Bluetooth connectivity is missing on this mouse - where the user is supposed to carry the receiver with the mouse all the time. (even there's a slot for the receiver underneath beside the battery insert.I highly recommend this mouse to all the users who are looking for a budget-friendly and efficient mouse."
adnan shaikh,1. Very nice for office work.2. Groves at side help you to grab mouse more firmly.3. Small and compact and sturdy finished product.4. You may use it for normal gaming not heavy gaming. for short duration5. I bought this budget mouse for Rs. 645/-
Amazon Customer,"Writing after 6 months of usage. Since it's slightly flatter than the other mouses, it will take some time to adjust to the grip. That said, the ergonomice is generally okish, but it's preferred for me. Major issue is that the mouse clicks have to be near the top edge of mouse, else it won't register. The more rounder Logitech mouse is preferred purely due to the click inconvenience."
Prachita Garodia,"Within 2 months the scroll wheel of the mouse failed.When I scroll down the screen moves 3 lines down and then 2 lines up.This has become a nuisance.I don't give a bad feedback about any product, but, I am appalled by the support by Logitech.In these Covid times, they asked me to to travel 25 kms to get a ₹500 mouse repair.I am thinking of throwing this away.Probably not buying Logitech again."
Mihir,Again writing this review and I know amazon will not publish this review again. Product received is a used product with scratches and also the serial no does not match on the box and product.
Shiny Roy,"Very handy product. Logitech products are good for quality & durability. A on/off switch is provided which helps save the battery. AA Alkaline leak proof battery is also provided with the package. No red light, invisible infrared is used for operation.  Small grooves are provided on both sides of mouse for better grip & handling."
Rohan Singh,"It's a perfect size and good looking mouse, the only thing I dislike is the height of it so it's not a very good product for office workers, I can say best for Amateur gamers."
Nishant Sharma,"The product is flawless, but it stopped working after 1 month. I suspect the battery was not fresh. This is a lapse of part checking on behalf of the distributor before dispatching the product. Since the return window has closed, so I have to go to Logitech Distributor to get it replaced.EDIT: After replacing the battery it started working fine, until a week later when the ratchet wheel started giving backlash errors. The scrolling doesn't work smoothly. When I scroll up or down, the cursor goes down or up (respectively) also. I assume mouses are not that stable or robust as they used to be in the 2000s."
Kader Mohideen M,Decent mouse. Don't expect much. The optical light is invisible. Simple and basic performance. Good VFM.I think it should've had a little heft to it as  it is very light. Good for people who want lighter mouses.The scroll wheel is not rubberised and is hard plastic so it does have that pleasant soft clicky feel and is tak tak plasticky. Nothing you wont get used to.
Suneel,It’s Made in China product. They should have mentioned it details.So far product looks ok. It’s invisible optic means no light at the bottom. Let’s see how long battery works.
Amazon Customer,"Pros:Small receiver which can be tucked inside the mousePower ON/OFF buttonCon:Scroll stops working after a few weeks.I ordered this mouse and a few weeks after that, the scroll stopped working. But the mouse was a good fit for my hand. Thinking that it could probably be that I didn't use it probably and so the wheel stopped working. I ordered another and the same happened.If you use the scroll wheel, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE."
Shiv R.,Well my friend brought it i liked it then i bough it and this happened for 4 people and i wont lie we all are happy with this mouse. I may have dropped it 3 4 times by now as no wire is there but still no problem and we use it for gaming too works smooth .Dont spend too much on mouse buy this.
Yash Ganjoor,After spending almost 150 bucks a month on my HP wireless mouse that i paid 699 for. I switched to Logitech. I am so glad that i did. The only regret i have is that i didn't switch sooner. The mouse has a very ergonomic design making it very easy to hold. It just uses 1 AA battery which comes with the mouse. I purchased this about a month ago and i haven't changed the battery since. I would 100% recommend anyone to go for this.
prateek,"This mouse is very famous and there are high chances that its fake.after using few days I am getting lag in cursor movement.the scroll button is very loose and click buttons are not so good.its very lightweight and looks like made from poor material.overall quality is poor and 100%, I received a fake mouse."
SRI RAM GOPAL Naraharisetty,"It did not work at all. I bought it and did not use it immediately as I have to travel.Once I came back i opened it is not working. I kept a new battery but no use.I couldn't return the item as 8 days is over. And Amazon did not take responsibility. My money got wasted.Product, did not work at all after opening. Their quality control failed."
Leelamani,"I bougth this product from amazon.The packaging a way below average.But when I used it , it seemed fairly decent.IT makes clicking noises .....which if its a problem for you then do not even think of buying this product.... I dont mind the noise so that was not a issue for me.OVERALLif you dont mind the packaging and can live with clicking noises then you should go for it.Becoz (personally) I am not at all having any issue with this mouse and nor am I regretting buying it."
Anish,"Works perfectly fine. Is very good. Has an invisible optic ray, not the red one so that's another nice thing. No annoying red light at the bottom. Looks great, aesthetically pleasing (shape and colour wise) and ergonomic, feels good in hand. Use it for long hours drafting on AutoCAD. (I am an architecture student :p)"
aleena,"Deliverd today(16/06/20)Since i order a big basket thisbcame with it, pacakging as if we buy from a shop, comes with a batter, inserted inside the mouse-you have a tag just needs to pull it out. started using it with my laptop, first review it good. Will be updating after a month. About the battery and product."
Vicky,"Very ergonomic design but the dpi is not adjustable so it is not for gamingBest for office useGripping is very good hold of mouse is Excellent.Dont buy it for gaming but buy for office use and personal home useI USE them with my cctv camera, with  my Samsung TV and with my laptop while watching movies on bed.It's range is Excellent"
Janani kalanidhi,"exactly one year, this mouse stop working. this model is not good, dont go for it. i bought again M235  let see how good its, comfort wise M235 is far better than this model."
Narendra Gajala,"It's smooth like silk.  The packaging is great.  One very neat feature is that the wireless signal receiver when not in use can be tucked away inside a tiny slot within the mouse so, you don't loose it.  At this price what I received is pretty good in terms of built quality.  The device is shaped very ergonomically - feels good in hand.  Just plug it and play.  Very Logitechy :)"
Kindle Customer,Writing this review after 6 months of usage. I am using this for macbook pro with external dongle to attach the usb. You have to keep the usb dongle too close to the mouse else you will feel the lag or sometime it won't even work at all. If you are keeping the mouse too close to the usb then it will do the job as expected
Prashant,The mouse is super durable. Plastic quality is good and it soon gets connected when you on the laptop.  For weeks the mouse is on with laptop in sleep mode but it immediately responds when laptop or MacBook is active. Doesn’t consumes much of battery and it is usable on any surface including glass as well.
Ebrahim Ezzy,"Short and simple: It's a good buy, worth the price.The mouse is good enough to hold, even for big hands. Weight is not a problem.No perceivable lag, good buttons.Has an invisible(infrared) laser so better at night compared to regular red laser mice.You'll have to manually turn it off with the designated switch everytime, no auto off feature.All in all a good mouse if you're looking for a wireless option that is not too expensive, not too cheap."
Dinesh,The mouse is nice and good. No compromises in quality. It is really silent and the clicks and the wheel do not make any noise. But it is kind of small for people with large hands. Definitely not for gaming.
Amazon Customer,The bottom pads already have rough and heavy scratch marks on them. And the area where you apply pressure to open the battery area also has scratches and light dark patch. This can only come from extensive use.  This mouse seems to have been heavily used before and isn't brand new but pre-owned. Check attached images. advice everyone else to check upon unboxing.
Meghna Gilani,"I bought one of these, and it was working fine for a few months. So bought another one. The scroll on this one isn't working fine now. It makes a squeaky noise while scrolling and sometimes just doesn't work. Even if it's under warranty who is going to go and get it fixed and spend all that time and energy? You'd think the product would last at least till it's in warranty. No body makes solid stuff any more."
balphanso,"It's quite comfortable to use. Battery usage so far is adequate. I forgotten to switch it off post switching off the laptop, and the battery didn't die outVery easy to connect, especially with a work laptop"
Shiv,"The reason for the four star, is this is a good wireless mouse to start with, the reason i bought is the price and i would say I don't regret, pretty good, had two issues,a. the wifi interlacing- due to which the mouse pointer lag was horribly bad! solved it by placing the wifi usb dongle at different positions and the issue got solved.b. the speed of the pointer, you definitely need to adjust the speed thru control panel settings and reduce the speed otherwise you will feel lack of control.Other than these, I would say its a good deal at this price point."
Danesh Zaki,I have used this mouse earlier and it worked well for several years so bought it again. This one's mouse wheel stopped working in about 3 months. It would scroll up when I pushed it down and vice-versa.
Madhu Jana,Very crisp however a little too smooth n slides off the point onscreen when we are about to click. Slightly hard middle scroll button.First one was defective. However hot a replacement.
Parth,"Received defective product,both inner and outer packaging was bad, seal was not appropirate, the mouse on and off switch was on and the cell compartment was loose. And i learned that you can only apply for exchange with an electronic item but somehow i mangaed to talk to customer service and now getting a return with refund."
Rupeshwar S,"Lasted me a whole three years! Most of the mouses I owned gave up within a year, either the right click fails or the middle mouse button fails. This mouse is the first ever mouse that lasted me for this long, even though the right click has got a bit mushy and the middle mouse is a tad bit unresponsive at times and the protective pads beneath the mouse have fallen now, given the time it lasted, it is cool!  If you are looking for a compact mouse that lasts ages, GO FOR IT! :)"
Atreya Bhat,"Three star cuz I have always loved logitech and every mouse I have owned is of logitech. But this time It broke my trust. I have been using it for about 6 months now.. And since last month.. The scroll wheel is malfunctioning. If I scroll down, it scrolls up a little and then comes down. Its very annoying while zooming pictures or working in cad softwares. Making it unfit for use. Otherwise its a handy, cute mouse."
Dharmaraj Balagopalan,The size is too small for comfort and non user friendly. The right and left clicks work only if pressed at the tip end of the mouse almost at the front vertical drop. Bad buy. Only the scroll wheel works satisfactorily.
Siddhant Gupta,"Purchased this mouse a week ago. Overall good. Easy to hold but a bit short to fit in the palm. Working precisely. I use this mouse for both work and gaming. Accuracy is good. Only thing, I didn't like was the packaging. When I received the courier, there was no protection for the mouse. When I opened the parcel, mouse carton was distorted. Seller must pack the item properly so that product should not get damaged during transit."
Sachin Dahiya,This mouse is a wireless mouse and very handy. It is designed to look good and it is small in size. The range of this mouse is pretty good. It's not a gaming mouse.There is no need to install any software for connecting to laptop/desktop. Just plug the receiver and start using it.Overall it's a good product.
Rahul R.,"I can’t able to lodge the complaint for the quality. Within 2-3 months the scroll roller started to problem but not it’s totally failed.How to get it repair/replaced in warranty as Logitech giving 1 year warranty.Please guide me someone, or amazon please call me"
durga prasad,"Does the job well, had no issues connecting with linux machine. Feels sturdy feels quality product - suitable for office work, have not reviewed gaming performance but feel it is little small for gaming"
tusharanizer,"A good quality product.I use it for Excels, Presentations and regular deskwork stuff and it works perfectly well. The Plug and Play feature is seamless. The mouse os perfect for my palm size. The fit and finish is premium.I haven't used this for gaming but if I've to guess from my experience of its sensitivity and tactile feedback of the buttons, Gaming should be fine."
Nishant Bhati,"Well overall it's a fantastic product. Works like a charm, smooth and the range too is awesome, the only drawback I feel is that's it way to small in size for a person who got bigger hands. But don't consider it as a negetive point. It's best wireless mouse you can find on Amazon for this price range."
Saroopashree Kumaraguru,"The mouse is good for casual users. The built quality is good but not the quality that you would see in a high end gaming mouse. I would not recommend this for gamers because of the higher latency. This would entirely disrupt your gaming experience. For stuffs like normal browsing, editing documents, using designing softwares, this mouse is good to go with.For the money you pay, this product won't make you regret at all."
Akshaykumar Chavan,It is very good low budget mouse and it working fine.it operates in 100 meter range and it is very comfortable while using and pressing of key is very smooth and 12 months battery life also preety good. i am using this mouse from 1 month and it working fine i will personaly reccommend you to buy this product
Joshua,"I was expecting the mouse to be decent sized, but its small and not comfortable to use.If you're looking for a portable / small temporary mouse then this is good, else, please look for other options."
Venkateswarlu dounthu,Let me start from the mouse bilt quality it is super. It is easy to hold its fit in hand wait less. it's working up to 10 metters distance. Battery is good it giving the long time backup. For gaming purpus it is not fit. Becouse it is not a gaming mouse it use for offical purpuse only. Logitech is good product I bye this product Rs 475. This amount is the applicable for this product and this performance.
Kumar A.,"It feels better being trapped entirely in the palm, and the operating speed is excellent. Still, I don't think it is suitable for gaming. However, I am a programmer and not a hardcore gamer. The best thing about it is the low battery consumption."
Purnima Gupta,Very happy with the product. Though sometimes the arrow tends to disappear and hang.But overall really good. I like the fact there's no annoying light in the bottom also.The keys are snooth anf touch is also good
happycamper,"At work, I have to carry around my laptop and work at different desks. Using the laptop keypad made my hands and forearms hurt but I hated carrying around a wired mouse that was unwieldy. I love this small, durable and lightweight mouse. It's made me more efficient."
Shobhit Lohia,I bought this product on October 1st 2017 and it stopped working last week. It worked great for 1 year but for past 1 month it had been showing issues in terms of click response and bluetooth connection. I am a very light user and never used it for gaming.If you wanna buy a mouse for gaming and longer life then please don't buy this one. Its only meant for light usage and shorter shelf life.
Amazon Customer,"Worst ever wireless mouse I've ever used. Writing review after 8 months of daily use. Most of the time it points at the point where you don't click. Ergonomically it's the worst, you actually have no control of its movement. At times I throw it with utmost disappointment. I couldn't control my disappointment and broke it today. I'll never buy any electronic stuff from Amazon in future."
Mohammed Imran R,"I've been using this mouse for a month now. It's a good mouse. but it is not for gaming. It's perfect for travel and that is all it is good for. the mouse itself is small in size and the keys are very tactile, I would recommend this if you do a lot of traveling. but if you work from home or an office then you should invest in an ergonomic mouse like Logitech MX master 2s or Logitech MX master 3(If you can find it)."
Aditya Kothari,"ProsEasy to hold.Easy to carry.Good grip.Decent battery life. (I turn it off when not in use for long hours)Been using for few months, no complaints.ConsSlightly light in weight, but works for me.If you strictly prefer heavier ones go with other options.OverallGreat buy if you don't wanna spend too much on a mouse and don't wanna compromise on quality."
Swapnil Jadhav,"Great Product easy to hold and ergonomic.To add on I bought it when my old Logitech wired mouse stopped working suddenly, and I was clue less sitting at home in rains !I ordered this mouse and being a prime customer I ordered it at around 12:30PM and mouse was delivered in my hands at 3:30PM.Kudos to Amazon prime !!"
Kavinraj,"I have purchased this mouse on 3rd time. After every year completion, the mouse scroll is not working. But I like the finishing and Ruger type.When I read the description it says that ""12-Month Battery Life: Don’t worry about constant battery changes as this wired Logitech mouse has 12-month battery life."" where it is not true. Please update the content with a real-time value like 3month or 2month."
Suman,"Guys,Update : after using I realised using proper setting in your system for mouse you can get rid of the sensitivity issue. It's nice durable mouse. Go for it!This is the worst mouse I have used. This actually works only the rough surface but don't work on soft surface like table top, desktop and not even on top of the paper. I din't use this product for more than a  week after it was delivered so could not return. If there is an option to return I would definitely return this product. I strongly do not recommend this product.."
Harvinder Singh,I have received the product with broken cover. Also the mouse inside was already used before. It was not a fresh piece. There were scratches on the foot plastic of mouse which shows the mouse is previously used by someone. Ordered for replacement.
Ameya Shejale,"Tracking is great, comfortable to use, ergonomic design.Can't comment on battery life. It's only the first day. Download the Logitech support app to change the settings (tracking speed, left-right invert etc.)There's nothing more to it really. There's plenty of options available at this price range. You can't go wrong buying any mouse. This works well for me."
Arunav Khare,"Very good mouse by Logitech. It feels quite sturdy and is neither too small nor big. Buttons are soft and easy to click and scroll feels good. Price wise, at this time of pandemic, buy from Reliance digital online than from Amazon. I got it for Rs. 549 only at that store"
Alfred,"Awesome... When i bought it i was searching for the wireless usb of the mouse, guess what it's inserted very neatly inside the battery panel section on the back. Mouse works excellent, wireless connectivity is excellent."
Yash Shah,i've bought the mouse 5 months ago and the mouse has worked really well but the size of the mouse is a bit small so if your buying it for gaming then this isnt the mouse for you and this is the best mouse youll get under 1k but if your looking for a mouse above 1k then i would recommend the magic mouse if your a apple user and the logitech g502 for window and apple.
Amazon Customer,im an architect so i use various design softwares which uses the middle scroll button very oftern for dragging desgins...after using this product for a month the middle scroll button starts to be irresponsive unless u apply some strong pressure....so im quite disapponted with this product
Neha Bidgar,"This was my first wireless Mouse buy after using a wired one previously. I really liked it. The build is good, easy in handling. The optic is without LED to save power. Also, it doesn't require a mouspad or any particular surface. It also works fine on the Floor tiles. Worth the price."
Lalrindika Varte,"Love this mouse to this day because of its low consumption of battery(meaning 2 pencil batteries last me a total year under daily usage). Although the left click button have started to act up since last week. Still, a great buy."
Biju,"The LED indicator of the mouse does not work, the left click of the mouse repsone is also slow, would recommend the purchase only of no other option is available."
Babu,"A big no for medium and big palms people, very hard to manage the tracking of the pointer.leaving size issues aside even the tracking is not accurate, I personally felt that the pointer control is bit difficult with this mouse. sometimes even 2 clicks doesn't select or open the item."
eddy,Decided to get this after seeing so many positive reviews and also using the same mouse at work. The piece I received has a loose battery cover & it makes noises when used. Packing too was quite shabby/distorted and hence I've deducted two stars. Otherwise it works fine.
Rahul Saini,I have very little use of my personal laptop around 1-2 hour per day. After 6 months scroll wheel not working of this mouse. Money Wasted Product...
Jaskeerat Singh,"I've started using this mouse with my Mac. Though design & hold is perfect but buttons doesn't work smoothly. Have to press buttons multiple times to select a file. In this price range, it should've been a smooth mouse.Mi wireless mouse is Rs. 100 cheaper than this & have heard good reviews about that product. If you're planning on buying this product, would seriously recommend checking out Mi mouse as well."
Tejas Gupta,"Its a great mouse, Nice quality at a fine price....BUT, SIZE IS THE PROBLEMIts nice to hold but TOO COMPACT which makes it SMALLER THAN REGULAR SIZED MOUSE and hence i dont find it very comfortable to hold and use. I ll return it and find an other alternative but IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER HAND, PERFECT MOUSE."
Saurabh Bhivandkar,The mouse is the lower end version of m171 and works the same way. I bought it for my dell notebook and haven't experienced mishaps of misclicks as yet. So I'd suggest it was a good buy.
Tania,"I personally find myself comfortable using the laptop with the mouse. Scrolling down pdfs happens with absolute ease. This ergonomic Logitech mouse helps you to use laptop swiftly, with ease and comfortably."
Akhil Chandran,"I use this with my Chromebook.This is one of the best purchase I ever did.Looks good, works like charm. Battery lasting as well.If You don't want to deal with wires then buy this without doubt."
Puneet Agarwal,"The roller for scroll up and scroll down stopped working in 4 months. I work in IT industry, I have high usage - say about 5-6 hours a day ( not more at all). I maintained the mouse with a lot of care, even then the roller has stopped working. Very bad mouse for so much of money."
Brendon Fernandes,"The mouse is well built and does it's job well. It feels nice in the hand, it looks pretty neat, and works as it should. The click feels a bit cheap but for the price/brand it's understandable. The middle button is a bit hard to press, but that is something I can live with.It's a nice branded mouse to buy in this segment imo."
Imnatoshi,It's been three months since my purchase and the mouse is functioning well. It is a small mouse and well suited for carrying around. Good for everyday and general office use. It doesn't come with dpi adjuster but that is expected as it is not a gaming mouse.
aryn,"It's an amazing mouse, especially for its price. I upgraded from a Logitech M380 and I gotta say, Logitech makes the best mouses. The only discernible problem is that as with the M380, I am afraid the right click on this mouse too might stop working. Albeit, at the this price it is very much worth it as I had to upgrade my mouse after 3 years.If you require a mouse for daily work and don't have any specific use case such as gaming or video editing, this is the mouse to go for."
ROHIT BHATIA,If you believe in ergonomics then this mouse is for you. Build quality of mouse is good. Its very light weigh without battery.In my case It did not comes with Battery.It has built in space to keep dongle in the mouse. Its a good for who loves to work during travel
Sagar Tahelyani,"Good one. Dell is my favorite brand but I want to try Logitech also. And I like the product. Easy to hold and very smooth. For gaming level, smoothness is less as compared to other gaming mouse. After all this is likely professional mouse."
Kindle Customer,Got it within 3 days of ordering so thanks to amazon. This mouse is really handy and good for normal tasks. Would not recommend this for gaming though.For the price this is really good because of the side grip.
Mathan,First thing:The receiver is inside the mouse. It's won't come as seperate.The setup is quick and hastle free. Just plugin the receiver and start use it right away.It's suitable for office and general purpose. Not for gaming.
Mitakshi,"Be it the gripping power, sensitivity or ease in pairing, this is the best wireless I have come across. I used other wireless mouse also but found these to be best. BTW this is my second purchase for same item. I am in love with this product."
krishna kumar thakur,Little costlier but works fine. Used for almsot a year no complaint. Range is not much and there shouldn't be any obstacle between the mouse and adaptor to work properly
Amazon customer,No response after one and half month. no system to get this replace as well.  Please help to get the replaced under warranty. Product claims warranty for 1 year & it dies in a month and half.
Kavya Kavuri,The product looks exactly as shown. It is easy to hold and works perfectly with laptop for work purpose. There's no lag in using the mouse but I haven't used it for gaming.
Naman Punia,Its a really great mouse at a great price. Its matt body is very comfortable. Even after using it for a long time I have no problem due to hand sweat. Its ergonomic in design. Its correct sized for your hands. No issues in connectivity. Overall a superb product from logitech.
Anurag Jindal,"Writing my review after 15 days of daily usage>First of all hands down,it has to be called the beast of the budget section in wireless mouse.The response time of the mouse is excellent.The build quality is very good considering its price point.The mouse comes with the cell, which is appreciable.The buttons are responsive and easy to use.The invisible optic(Led light) is a great feature to have especially in night time.>One thing,if your palm is very big then this could feel a bit small to you.>Consdering the price point,Its not for hardcore gamers.Overall a superb deal 🤝"
Ravi,"I had to buy this mouse every year for moderate use without gaming. The click is reassuring, grip is comfortable but this mouse dies too early."
Anand Kumar,"I bought in Nov 2017 and worked pretty good till 2018 end. Since last 3 months it is giving trouble, and it is getting worse day by day. Now i am looking to buy another mouse. I guess a decent wireless mouse should work good for atleast 3 years (which my last mouse did)."
Lovelesh Soni,The mouse is very good. The design feels comfortable while holding. The mouse invisible optic laser as compared to the traditional red laser at the bottom. Size of the mouse is small compared to other mouse but it's okay as long as it is durable.The price could have been little less than Rs. 600
Aneelian,Too small. Does not have the grip to lift the mouse (when moving it on the pad). Good battery life. Good range. compact. Get yourself the normal sized one. I don't think I'm saving any space with a smaller mouse.
sadheesh kumar p,"Am not sure if i can return, the product is good - but am sure its already used and packed again - i can see few scratches at the bottom of the mouse .. what should i do now, will i get a refund for this product , am not getting connected to customer care.."
Apurva Srivastava,"This is a very comfortable and easy to use mouse. No frills or add on features like battery light indicator, additional buttons etc., but seems rugged overall. Black colour is an added advantage as it hides signs of wear and tear quite well."
UB,"Its economic if we compare to other wireless mouse and the company ofcourse.But the mouse size is small which makes it difficult to work for long hours which is required in daily corporate job. So my suggestion is if you are looking for a economic mouse and only need for couple of hours , then you can think about buying this mouse otherwise go for other better options available in the market"
Cuphead,"Hi!The box was damaged when I received it.The scroller got spoilt on the second day itself.The cursor doesn't stay stable at all, terrible for gaming or any precise work including steady movements.Think before you buy this product, the low price is to sway you away from it's evident flaws"
Aditya Dhanda,Mouse is very light in weight which makes it very good for normal use . Size is not that big which is helpful for people having normal to small size hands. Overall a quality product.
ABHINAV BARO,I have been using the mouse for last 2 months and it's pretty decent for the price that it comes on. I use it on a daily basis and I have no complaints regarding it's functioning. You can go for it if you feel like but be sure it's only for home & office purpose and NOT GAMING.Cheerio!
Bodhisattva,"very easy to use, curved side helps with a comfortable grip.Battery never runs out, have been using for few months now.connects without any problem every time I connect it to my laptop.Must Recommend...."
Sachin,The product is good and of sturdy built. It does not feel cheap at any corner.The con for me is it's size. It is very small almost half the size of my palm which makes it a bit complicated to use and not very comfy.Also the scroll button is a bit hard to press considering that only half the palm stays on top of the mouse.
Sunny Khanduja,"I was using this on a daily basis and one fine day when I took it out of the Laptop Bag, it stopped working. If you would check the reviews there are alot of reviews which talks about exactly this problem. DO NOT BUY THIS. SPEND COUPLE OF 100s MORE AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
Komal P.,I bought this on 13th Aug 2019 and recieved my order on 16th August 2019 it's been couple of months the mouse has stopped working. I tried changing the battery and even tried using on other laptop but no change. It's been a pathetic product not even worked for few months after spending reasonable amount of money. It's needs to be under warranty and i would like to claim for exchanging my product.
Ranjith H,I have worked around computer for over a decade now but never had wireless mouse all this while! This was my first one and it's great. The sensitivity is slightly higher than usual but the response time seems better than wired mice! Its lighter.Runs with a single AA battery. I guess I will have to figure the run time.
Piyush lawatre,"My Product Scroll wheel is making extremely high noise , even my cheap Chinese 5 year old mouse makes no noticeable noise can see in above video , Have applied for replacement hope this another won't let me down"
Koushal Parmar,Product is no doubt working smoothly but the way it is packed totally thrassled down during shipping. Need improvement in packaging and taking care while shipping any product.
Niketh,"18-12-2020:- Bought for Rs.599/-. One month completed. Working fine till now.14-02-2020:- 3months over, Scrolling button having some problem. The scroll button click is functioning only if press hard and hold for some time.Not expected to malfunction within this short period."
Kishan Bagthariya,"It is a good mouse with invisible laser. Easy to hold, robust build quality and DPI is also quite good. I wouldn't recommend this one for gaming. Suitable for office use and normal use.Don't return the mouse saying 'USB missing'. You will find usb inside the back of the mouse right beside the battery."
Amber Abbas,"The mouse looks and works like a charm. It's pretty much excellent for day to day web surfing etc. But, it is NOT a gaming mouse. The DPI just isn't high enough for gaming. Also, somehow when I received the mouse, the pads on the mouse were a little worn out. So, look out for that! All in all, Go ahead! You won't regret it."
Sonal,"I purchased the mouse about 10 months back, and suddenly it stopped working properly.  Even though it has 1 year warranty, I am not able to register the product with Logitech, as the model B170 is not appears to be a logitech mouse model or logitech has stopped providing support to this mouse. Wondering, how Amazon and Cloudtail are selling such a product which is having no support with manufacturer and claiming that it has 1 year warranty. I don't know now, where to reach for getting warranty claim.Otherwise, the product was comfortable in use till the time it worked properly."
Amazon Customer,"Exactly  one month of use, sensitivity became very poor that iam not able move cursor, but scroll and clicks  are working fine. changed battery still the same issue so dissembled the mouse by looking some video's on YouTube and found that the internal wire plug to the sensor was disconnected, fixed it and was working fine."
Suwaid Akbar,This is good only for people with small hands and people who use it for work related accltivity...not suitable for gaming.Product is good.
Amazon Customer,Been  using it for 3 weeks.This are my initial impressions:1. Build - The build quality is good and feels good to hold in hand.2. Design - Stylish.3. Performance - Very easy to use.haven't faced any problems.easily connects and never faced any lag/connection lost issues.4. Duration- as of now working great. will have to check the battery life in long run.and finally a good product for day to day and office usage.
Amazon Customer,The product itself seems to be good and the delievery was quite fast as well but the packaging was pathetic. The box was broken and the product seems to be used. Will update about the product in a months time.
KR,"I have been using this mouse since May 2017 continuously. I never changed the battery. I think I dropped it every single day. This mouse is a rugged, no-frill mouse for daily usage. It is most suitable for people who like a small mouse. It's not exactly small but medium-sized.  After 2 and half years, the scroll button just gave away :( . Buying this mouse again."
Kaustubh Sharma,Better than any other mouse. Had used lot many but this works like a breeze.Using it for a month and better than HP or portronics
Amazon Customer,"This quality is not good, it stopped working in less than 6 months. I bought it on 19 Dec 2019 and today is 20 June 2020. I really disappointed with the performance. Now I think Dell was the perfect brand in the mouse which I used for 4 years without any issue."
Ashutosh Sharma,"Received mouse on time. The quality of the mouse looks very well and solid built. It was easy to set it up just plug n use. Works on every surface. In all, i invested my money in good product and m very satisfied. But i just wonder one thing that isn't the price too much?"
Manveer Singh,"Good mouse for daily usage, I have also done gaming with this mouse and the performance of this mouse was top notch. The size of the mouse is little small but it feels really good in our hand."
Riz,"It's nice, the quality is just great. Once fell off the table, nothing happened. It is just little small to get the proper grip. Else every thing is just right. Easy plug and play"
Santosh Pati,"Good build, very compact and handy. An absolute companion for an ultra-book or a convertible.Edit: Although the mouse is good but after 1 year of usage the scroll wheel has started showing issues. It missed scrolls all the time. Not happy anymore and didn't lasted long"
Vikram,Using this mouse daily for almost 4 months now. No issues so far and really good. Very compact to hold. Great product for this pricing.
Abdul Rashid Dar,"I simply love logitech devices... This 🖱 is awesome, what i like about it the invisibility of optical light...2nd review after use of one monthMy expectations with logictech vanished, the device stopped working... Now do not how it to replace it, still in warranty"
Gautam Sarma,This product is hopeless and I couldn't able to return because the time was over by a day as I was outstationed from 22nd July to 2nd of AugustReally put me in frustration .Lost .Money with satisfaction.It was delivered on 22nd evening.
SWAPNIL,Good laptop mouse for daily use.... Grip is also good... Connectivity is awesome.... Design is great.... Just remember to switch off mouse button downside when you aren't using it.... Otherwise it will eat your battery...
Gururaj,Basic functionality works fine. I don't think this can be used for gaming but this works perfectly fine for daily work. It's a little small for me though.
Amazon Customer,"Very sleek design and sturdy to use. I must say the battery consumption technique is something to look forward to :) Been using it since 3 months and have also forgotten to turn off the mouse several times, still didn't needed to change the battery. Got it for 645/-"
Ashish,I really like this product and replaced my old wired mouse.It is quite durable as I dropped it multiple times but this tiny guy is still with me.
Vijay Singh Rathore,"This is my first wireless mouse and I was unwilling to shred too much money in this. In amazon sale I found this mouse and saw the price to be 499 only. Ordered it. When I went to a shop last night, shopkeeper asked 750 for same model. I refused and waited for delivery by amazon.Just now received it 3 days before expected delivery time.Packing intact and got amused by design of mouse. Simply Fantastic. Plugged to laptop and started working right away. I got 250 rs discount which is huge. Thumbs up."
techloris_109,"Its one of the best mouse i used, so edgy that you can do photoshop and design works. But my mouse stopped working after 1.5yrs of usage. Only in terms of lifetime I`m not satisfied from buying such a popular computing brand"
Pankaj P.,"This is the second piece I am using, having returned the first one. But it is having the same issue. It is not working even at a distance of 3 ft. Having used two of the same products and having encountered same issues, I strongly suggest that you dont go for this model."
Amazon Customer,"Works flawlessly ! Form factor is little small but not uncomfortably small.Ergonomics of clicking and scrolling is good.Surface finish is good for daily use , doesn't soil up or gets greasy.A little higher DPI would have helped in doing precision CAD work well but for the price point it performs optimally well."
Amazon Customer,"its small and handy. i am liking it. only drawback is - it does not have visible optical light. so, it does not become easily evident if the mouse is ON or OFF. I have to explicitly check the ON/OFF button for that."
Darth Vader,"Works as described. Simple plug & play interface.After 8 months of daily usage, the middle mouse button click has started to respond erratically. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't...However, the scroll feature doesn't seem to be affected by it and is working fineAll other functions working as expected. Surprisingly, the AA cell has also lasted more than 8 months and still going strong"
SKB,This is my first wireless mouse purchase & I liked it. Been using it for a month now. No issues yet. My most favourite feature in this is the invisible optical light. The USB receiver storage inside the mouse is also cool.
Karthik S.,"I bought this in May 2017. With an average use of 9 hours on weekdays, the original batteries that came with the pack have lasted till August 2018! This is very comfortable to hold and the connectivity is very reliable. Highly recommended!"
Sid Chatrath,The product has suddenly stopped working for me after using it from last 5 months. Though it worked perfectly for me for few months. But it has started to give me issues. The product is still under warranty and have asked Logitech to support on the said matter.
NiketanG,"Logitech is the best brand in Mouse and keyboard.The mouse is small and compact which makes it easier to carry. The buttons also feel great. Tracking is also great. It would be nice if the grip was made of rubber and not plastic. Another minor issue is that to insert the Nano receiver in Mouse, you need to open the cover below mouse."
Praveen Samudrala,"I use it daily office work and it has never disappointed me. It's comfortable to hold and works better than traditional mouse on many surfaces except on paper, on which traditional red LED mouse seems to work better. It's durable, survived 5 accidental drops. Haven't tried for gaming."
Avinesh Singh,The middle click stopped working after 3 weeks. Tried to reach out to Logitech support for warranty claim but I was asked to physically visit Logitech support center.Build quality otherwise looks good but the scroll is terrible and then middle/scroll click stopped working!
Jumbo,"Very good product. Movement and accuracy of cursor is very sharp and smooth.  It is compact and easy to use. Only thing is that the shape is a bit flat - I  am used to my earlier HP mouse which was a bit round and occupied my entire palm , giving a firmer grip."
Chinmay S Barhale,"It's a very good product. Best part of this mouse is USB connector fits inside mouse body. So when you're not using it, it stays with rest of the device rather misplacing it. Due to its size it's very easy to hold. So far haven't faces any battery issues."
laurel,After using it for  approx 2 years this product is still working nicely and I have dropped it so many times but it got such good durability and the battery life is good. The pan drive which is attached with the laptop is also working nicely.
Anant Deep Khattri,Didn't expected this quality from Logitech as i have been using mouse of Logitech from long back but Scroll of this product got malfunctioned just after one year even i had hardly used this mouse as i have desktop which i use more frequently else it's in terms of performance it's a nice product no lagging.
Crazybeans,The Mouse is just the right size to hold under your palm. It has ridges on the sides which facilitates an easier grip. I love the flat surface and overall shape and size.
Prakash,It is just okay.  But I found the response level a bit on the slower side.  Not as good as my old M215 Logitech wireless mouse that I have been having for over 4 years now.  But this one talks of better battery life.  Need to wait and watch.
Amazon Customer,With Logitech mice you can never go wrong and this mouse is no exception. However before considering to purchase it you should know that1. This is NOT a full size mouse. It's almost the same size as M235. A little bit wider but somewhat thinner.2. It works only with its own receiver. You CANNOT add it to a Logitech unifying receiver.These  are some answers in the Q&A section which create confusion about these two points.
Ambareesh,"Awesome Is the word. .very responsive .. quick connect. .... Good bty life. ... Build Quality is good plastic but be care ... Won t withstand falls or of you loosely put it your backpack and travel , buttons might get Damaged or break."
Nikhil,"Logitech is a very well known brand for computer accessories and it certainly doesn't do any harm to that.A wireless mouse with an elegant design, straightforward functionality, and an economical price tag. There really isn't much to find faults!"
Tej,"Was working all good.. But after just 40 days of purchase, it stopped working. Registered a complaint on Logitech India site. No response.Tweeted to them. No response. Didn't expect this from Logitech.. Deeply disappointed."
Amazon Customer,this this the second purchase of the same mouse. the middle button for design works not working properly. it need to press hard to make the selection. I tried to contact the Product Support Logitech Distributor Service Center in India Tel: 000 800 440 2450. Its unanswerable. paid 599 /-. waste of money. who looking for the design works please don't go with this mice.
Amazon Customer,"Defective product ,mouse not workingno lights on it , changed battery still no luck.didnt recieve the end connector to connect to laptop.Feel cheated as Rs 650 down the drain.My fault that  i didnt check the package in the two weeks return period , hence unable to return it"
Bhupesh Patel,"I just loved this Mouse. Logitech made this product very carefully. Easy to use, scroll is good, grip is perfect, and most importantly left and right clicks working fantastic."
Kaushiki A.,"Definately not for gaming but it's just a normal mouse for dat to day use and will get the job done. At this price I would recommend a wired mouse instead if u r into gaming ,Also note that if u have a big hand this product is not for you the mouse is really small"
Pranjal,Its been developed for normal routine work. Wouldn’t suggest for gaming. Does the job well and is sleek and easy to play around with.
G. Sanjay,Likes: good finish low battery consumptionDislike: on off switch is micro sized needs to b operated by pen or pencil Rest fineOverall 4 star product
Ashish Kapur,"Despite no heavy use, the scroll wheel has started malfunctioning. Its relatively new, but is not functioning properly. Very annoying. Logitech needs some quality control. No one would visit your office for get rs. 600 mouse repaired."
Nani1991,Love to use this product. Purchased this product for the 2nd time as the first one gave me good experience. Unfortunately I lost the one which was bought earlier..
Nischit,"The mouse is good for regular usage. Works without hassle. The lightless feature is good for usage in night.If you are looking for a good wireless mouse for daily usage, then this is a preferred choice"
Priya,"I wasn't sure if this would be a good buy but so far it has exceeded my expectations. I am sure I will be rebuying the product soon for my family and friends.A month or so in, it is still working great."
Amit Verma,Nice In design and flexibility but after use of one month it's click stop working. Firstly wheel not respond.Please improve quality of used equipment in this device according to charged amount of this product.No one have rights to play witb customer's satisfaction.
Balakrishna,Product is good but the signal becomes weak if the Bluetooth receiver is 40-50 cm’s away and if there is anything in between the mouse and the receiver.
sourin roy,Just awesome for regular use! Only a little wierd for gaming. But you get used to it! If you are not a hardcore gamers type and more like a frequent pc user it's for you
Milind Deshpande,"The connecting device to the lap-top is hidden in the battery section. Please make purchaser's aware that it is placed there. I once returned it, thinking it is missing. The next time I insisted the delivery amazon personnel to assist. We both searched for it and located it."
Pradeep Narayanam,"Value for money and good quality. When I received i feel like top button parts are bit delicate. But after fell down from my hand accidentally around 3 times, still working perfectly fine and no damage at all."
Amazon Customer,Hard to believe one can get such a durable product for 500 rs.No lag whatsoever in operating. Mouse is a bit small but ergonomic. Won't be a problem unless you have large hands. Buttons are great. Not intended for gaming.
Haswanth Gorle,"Perfect for daily use , but not for gaming. Sometimes due to lack of rubber grip (body is full plastic) it tends to slip off the hand especially if hands are sweaty(if no mouse pad is used)."
SHUMYANIL R.,I bought this product in Jan. After 6 months it's not working when called Amazon they asked to call Logitech and when called Logitech they asked to visit there service center in Okhla Delhi. For 600 rupees mouse it's not worth to travel and even when they are not sure to give replacement. Poor service and wastage of time.
Abhishek Jain,"Very nice, sides grip is perfect for holding and scroller grip is also perfect, value for money"
Praveen,When there is no bluetooth dongle how can you connect the mouse? It was written on the box that it includes the dongle but I got a replacement as well but neither did contain the dongle.
SUNIL KUMAR SINGH,Product is of good quality. Only thing is its not as big as seen in the picture. Slightly smaller than normal office mouse.
Tarique Jamil,I bought this mouse in June 2020 and it is August 2020 and it has stopped working. I mean it works highly intermittently and with some banging on the desk. I am clueless what to do with it? Is it under warranty replacement? Amazon does not have option for replacement.
Amazon Customer,"This model of Logitech mouse has started giving problems after 3 months itself. The cursor keeps flying on the screen. Didnt expect this . Worst is, now I cant exchange it..."
Amazon Customer,"Since mouse doesn't have any LED light above or below, It is very difficult recognize whether the device is ON or OFF. It will leads to unnecessarily keeping in ON condition and there by fast draining of battery.Everything else with this product is outstanding."
Maanav agrawal,I am highly disappointed as i love logitech products and i got this for my android tv just bcoz it says it has a range of 10m. It didn't work on the tv do i tried it with my laptop but unfortunately then also it doesn't work if the mouse it even 2m away. Please seller contact me as i think the mouse is faulty.
Sushil Kumar narnoli,"the mouse is good for small , middle sized handshighly programmable with ligitech optionsonly con is that the scroll wheel is bit squikey"
Nachiket D.,Excellent mouse perfect for day to day use. It is a normal mouse with superb quality and finishing but not at all for heavy gaming. The Build quality and ergonomics are amazing and doesn't feel any uncomfortable to palm or fingers.
Shinjini,"would recommend for light users of mouse, but it can get very clicky and the noise can be annoying, its good quality, batteries last long and even after dropping a few times, it still works well, except clicking the scroll wheel is slightly problematic"
Himanshu Singh,This is very nice and compact wireless mouse. On inserting the dongle it took just a minute to load the driver and since then it is working perfectly.Those looking for gaming purpose might find the size on smaller side.
athuljestinjoy,the mice is good enough for daily use. Not for gaming. high quality and accuracy. just go for this if u are looking for a  normal use mice. best in this price.
Vijay,Good Quality Mouse. No rubber coat on side. Look like rubber grip. Lite weight and Logitech quality. Clicks are noticeable. Good to Carry.
Alok,I had another model of Logitech wireless mouse. It was very good. This product looked good so I purchased it. Big mistake. When I scroll down or up using the mouse there is a screeching sound. It's little irritating. I don't recommend this model of logitech
Amazon Customer,The product worked decently for 6 months but suddenly the scroll button has stopped functioning with no recourse to replacement.This has been an issue with many other buyers too and I suggest you refrain from buying this project.
Rita Gaur,The mouse when moved horizontal takes the cursor diagonal. Unable to replace as I threw the name tags and packing
Shourya Pratap,This mouse fells and looks really goodSensor is very good on almost all kind of surface.Received this with a preinstalled cell.Only thing I felt bad was it's size is half of my palm and makes it little bit hard for gaming.
RG,"In my earlier review i mentioned that the UBS device was not provided by the seller. Actually it was inside the mouse so not visible. So people who order it, do check the UBS device on the left side of the battery slot."
Nyhna da Cunha,"The product works really great. I have no concerns with it.Only thing, when I received it, the battery inside it wasn’t working and hence I’ve given it a lower rating."
prashanth,Doesn't work well pointer moves hapazardly worst product tested with another mouse of my friend same problem. Don't buy.
Prajwal Dhatwalia,Pros:1. Well built2. Inbuilt slot for storing USB connector3. Perfect weight distributionCons:1. Slightly small for MY hand2. Slightly pricey
Laraib khan,All total products are ghatiya and takes high price gets cheap products please don't buy any products currently I was book a Denver deo but today I am receiving Denver talc and no return option for this product so today's i decided that I will not purchase any things from Amazon
Sunil Kumar,"Looks Good. just plugged it and it worked fine.But when I checked it with Logitech there is no model named B170. Logitech has model M171 with same design.Also, the s/n on the mouse and the box are different, and when you try to search the product with the s/n with Logitech it says ""No Product found with the given serial number""."
Amazon Customer,"Serial number on the box and on the mouse were different which might go on to say that the product might be spurious. Ordered a replacement, still the serial numbers did not match....have requested a refund."
Amazon Customer,The best ever of its kind.right from battery life  to accuracy. Can't deny to rate 5 at the price i got rs 500. I dont use for gaming so i dont know
Amazon Customer,Logitech wireless mouse is best bang for the money. It works very smoothly. Battery lasts for long time. Ergonomically designed and very comfortable to use. Definitely recommended. Hope it lasts for couple of years....
Deep,"I am almost nearing to the second year with this mouse, still, I haven't changed the battery. Durability and the hold of the product are top notch. If you're looking for a mouse in the budget and highly durable this will be the best choice.Note;- My usage is limited to 1 to 2 hours per day, an average of 5 to 6 hrs per week."
Harsha,This was the first and Best wireless mouse I ever used even after 2 years it is working like magic...
Palak,"Didn't like the packaging though.. I like the mouse.. easy to hold .. can work on lap , table , clothes , bed .... Everywhere...I loved it ... Working properly..."
Ritesh kaushik,"A bit slippery, should have a surface providing grip. Doesn't feel comfortable while holding bcs of the grip and chances of slipping from hand.Rest light weight and made tough , resoponse is also great. Still i fell prices are a bit high though. If proded better grip surface would have been a plus point. rest its a great product go for it"
Venkatesh,"Stopped Working, used for 2 months and 12 days. Mainly used for smart TV. Since bought for 500 not going to spend time and effort on warranty. It's going to Trash."
Manan Jain,"Worth of it ..Just Bought it for 499 Good performance, I am satisfied by quality , Small in size, Running with windows 7 and OTG supportable mobiles also.Alkaline battery is already fitted, its just ready to useOverall good looking and nice product"
Mohan iyer,A good quality product. The irritating infrared light is not there in this product and hence the battery last longer almost thrice .
Swati Banerjee,"After 6 months of moderate use, the scroll wheel is defective. It behaves abnormally. Hence the mouse becomes useless. No sign of wear and tear though."
Tamal Bhowmick,Bluetooth range is awesome 👌Small and cost effective!!Easy to set up!!Highly recommended!!
PSB,Its never happened as I use a lot of Logitech Stuff but this one conked off in just 90 days. Not happy that I am stuck with a purchase that I cannot return despite it being a faulty piece. It sucks!
Amazon Customer,"mouse not working after use of 6 month. there is no way to contact to seller, even amazon dont have proper contact detail, they provided me one gmail id, no response from that id, even after doping so many mail, not able to replace it even t is under warranty"
Vincent,Yes the product is good.. the built quality is quite good. It’s does flash the red light it’s invisible.. that’s what I like and it works well I give 2 star for the packing..

Santosh,"I bought this for a daily office use and its good for that matter, although its little small in built but its fine and doesn't causes much"
Ponnuru Mahendra,Good Product. Value for money. Battery life is long. Only problem is the click sound is loud and creates discomfort in meetings
VINOD VERMA,It does what it is supposed to do.You will find the same item at your local market may be at lowerprice.Nothing special discount offered here
Krishna,"I have been using this product for months and writing this review.Pros:1.Never changed battery till date(even forgot to switch off the mouse sometimes)2.Compact and easy to use.3.Connect and never worry a bit.Cons:Have not faced any.So if you are thinking about this product, go for it without any doubt."
Lohith,"Writing after more than year usage. Very good quality. I dint kw how many times it fell from my hand but still going smoot without any issues. Very comfortable to hold and work. Go for it, 5* from my end"

Umang Taneja,1. Works excellent with Macbook air2. Right ergonomics3. Matt finish is good to holdI recommend the product
rohit singh,This wireless from Logitech serves the purpose. It's well-built and fits snugly in both mine and my dad's hands.No complaints at all.
Shaji A M,"Waste product. Waste of money. B170 optical mouse scroll wheel gone faulty within warranty period, not able to create complaint in logitech support site or by phone. Its annoying. Need to throw away, no other options."
BG,Just plug and play..Works like a breeze! It also have a on/off button to save battery. Too good.
Amazon Customer,"Firstly, the mouse is as shown in the pictures with no change in design.It has a smooth but firm texture, with grips on the sides for more handling.The tacking speed and pressure are all adjustable , and this works perfectly for both Windows and Mac computers.It is a Value for Money product, and those who are looking for mice which are economical but of high quality this is my suggestion to you."
Amazon Customer,This was bought after looking at weight in grams. There are colleagues who are using bluetooth mouse but it was pain when you switch from wired to wireless.This was really worth it. It feels almost same like wired while handling
Ancy Fernandes,"I ordered it on 7th July and by 10th August, it has stopped working for no reason, just out of the blue. I’ve switched batteries but that doesn’t help.Looking at others reviews, seems like this Seller sells devices which won’t last long"
AmZoneSynced,Battery life is expected to run as good as the battery inserted and durability I assume... the quality is good to last a good time. Good medium size .. instant use.
Ridim,Bad rating because In under 9 months the scroll button has stopped working. Didn't expect this from Logitech. The product shant vibe with a warranty.
Bala,The light didn’t glow when turned on so I thought it wasn’t working. I understand that in this mouse the light doesn’t glow al the time but the mouse works.
Guru U.,perfect wireless mouse. good shape to hold and easy to use. very satisfied with it's performance
Hari,"For all who are going to buy this mouse.Please don’t return it just because the wireless usb receiver is missing!!It is hidden in the mouse next to the batteryOverall the mouse is pretty good.But,way smaller than u expected!!👍🏼👍🏼"
ONGC A/C KARTIK MODI 121452,Product perfectly as described.  Must buy for all the laptop users at home as wells as office. Functions very flawlessly. No red laser light. It have invisible laser which i think shall increase battery life. It design is ergonomic and its easy to hold.
BISWAJIT SENAPATI,I bought this for my Macbook Air and it is not working as smoothly as it does in Windows.. Don't know why...
Kindle Customer,"Scroll issue came up within 2 months. Then, I researched online and found it is common with this model mouse. Go for other Logitech mice and not this."
Lopamudra Tripathy,"Good to have this product. Does the job and the battery life is good, doesn't drain out the battery. Never tried it for gaming though so can't comment on that. Good for normal use."
Akshaya shahi,"The product seems to be good but the flash light at the back of mouse is not working with which i initially thought that the mouse is not working and i have been delivered the defected piece which actually is defected, also i couldn't find any exchange option"
pavan,"Given the size is soo compact its performance is good, it works fine even on uneven surfaces like bed.durable and compact"
Vikas,"Its good, not for people with big hands since the mouse comparatively a little bit smaller than a standard mouse.Build quality looks good enough, i like the fact that there is no light blinking (personal opinion though)."
Sunil R.,"Have been using this mouse for about 2 yrs now. No problem what so ever. Very easy installation and comfortable to use for day to day activities. Most importantly, have not changed its battery since I am using it.. Means the power consumption is also good. Overall nice product."
Brijesh,awesome mouse. using for almost 6 months no issues nothing. works like a butter. receiver is so nano that you wont feel its in the port. superb quality. just go for it. battery life is awesome still using stock battery...where i've not replaced till date. logitech is best.

Samarth,Defective product. The cursors hangs or has lags when moved on the screen.Couldn't get a replacement due to lockdown
Partha Pratim Das,"Rugged and Reliable brand......had been using their various models for years, no complaints."
Amazon Customer,"I got this product for working on my laptop for MS Office tools and online research. This is an awesome product at such price and it has served my purpose. Though the feel could be improved by using better body material and better holding angle (surface arc can be a benchmark). Overall, great product with good battery duration."
Akhil Vijayan,Just got it today. Initial satisfaction is great. Good build. Easily connected to my Laptop.Its very ergonomic..your palm just fits on to the top.
Amazon Customer,"Comfortable and smooth, comes with an on-off switch to save battery. Overall a great buy and definitely better than the Dell WM126 which I had purchased before this. Go for it without any doubts."
Sanju,Very User friendly and ergonomic. It has been 3 years now. No complaints yet. I personally recommend this brand.
@thatdudeisindian,the product is good but for my hand it is little bit small. light weight product i'm afraid that i might broke if i handle it rough. i'll give 3.5 for this product. i would suggest if you can invest 200 rupees more please go for the other logitech product. over all you can buy the product but you have to handle it little bit smooth. note that it's not a gaming mouse.
Radha B,"Product is good,  but the issue is with seller.At first we received it with different serial num on box and mouse and used one, one can clearly see scratches. When we raised replacement request,this time also different serial num at least we got new one. Don't recommend this seller"
rahul purohit,Although I returned mine but I feel they are best in this range. I got then for 599 which was a pretty sweet deal. If you cannot afford much go for them otherwise MX master 2 are really nice for a good budget
Amazon Customer,It was hard to find the receiver. Its inside mouse when you open the back cover of the mouse. The product is really good 5 *.
Buyer certified,brought this in june; guys in like 5 monthsscroll wheel button is not working at all....I repeat guys the scroll wheel button is not working..... don't buy it for professional use.... please
Amazon Customer,"I am using this mouse since last one month. working very good, easy to handle, comfertable size of its for both gender. Only negative point what I feel, It make little more sound during the clicking. Otherwise all other featurs are good."
Chinmay.,Side texture allows a firm grip. Can be comfortable if you have small sized palm and fingers. Invisivle optic makes it difficult to understand whether the mouse is ON or OFF. Sensor is not capable for gaming. Might observe lag while gaming.
Vanik,"I had to buy two of these because I lost one in my computer lab, and had ot buy this to support my gaming laptop after my Thesis."
Prajwal S Bhujbalrao,Product is really good. It is light weight and small. My hand big ones but i dnt see any problem while using it. 👍🏻For the product. But when i opened the packet and check the mouse i found that it has scratches on below surface. This scratches shows that this mouse is used one. Soo 👎🏻 For the seller.
Parth Sachdev,It's almost a year since I have bought the mouse and I didn't have to change the battery even once. It does not have a red light on its bottom which makes it very last long without changing batteries. But it is not very quiet like many other mouses.
Manoj Gupta,"Technically good product, no issues with it what so ever.But me being a tall person with little big hands , it just feels too tiny and uncomfortable in hand for long usage specially if one's looking to use it for work. Casual usage may be fine."
Amazon Customer,Clicky buttons.. scrolling is a bit rough.. little small to my liking..
Ritwik P.,"Really good, the size is a little small but it is really ergonomic and does not interfere with your work, you're able to work easily and the grip and sensitivity is great too. The buttons and mouse wheel have a nice click to it."
Bimol RJ,Hurry to get a new mouse ...saw this and ordered it... Good  item ..good gaming support as well ...i think its good because of the higher DPI
Shoeb Rupani,The mouse is ergonomic but it's still on the flater side on the curvature. Yet its decent enough at its price point.
Rubin,"The mouse was not new. It was used earlier. Fortunately it is working. Return of Amazon ordered products are big hassle. Many times you don't get the money back. And even worse is that many times the return is not recorded.So, satisfied with the pre used mouse!"
".Adnan ""kaka"" Rayees","Personally love heavy mouses, nit-picking here, but its Too small even for small hands, doesn't sit well and is very light, even the sound of the click really starts getting on the nerveBut if you are on the lookout for a cheap wls mouse that's tiny enough to fit anywhere look no further!!"
piyush chandrawanshi,It's been 2 years since I've been using this mouse.It's really goodGood rangeIt's comes with a pre-installed battery cell and I've not changed it since I bought it. The cell it came with is still going good .
Pankaj,"Mouse is very comfortable to use but within 3 months scroller stops working, and it sucks to work with this mouse on programming. If you are going to use this mouse for programming, then choose another or better to go with touch mouse if available."
Satish,"I had ordered this a day before and it got delivered on another .Pros1) no setup required , just plug and start using2) nice build quality .Cons1) small to use wrt to wired mouse2) too light to handle ."
Joseph,"a very good product from logitech, although the price is a little more it is worth every single penny, has fallen down several times and still no problem. fits in the hand well and love the design. 4 stars only because this is my first wireless mouse and i donno how good it is compared to other products out there."
Shreekant,Works well from any corner of my room. Takes less space in my office bag and the secret space of its adapter inside the mouse was a good idea of the manufacturer.
Hello Boss,"Good product, have been using for 6 months now.It's pretty small in the hands.Convenient for moderate use.Not preferred for gaming.Happy with the product, infact this is my 2nd purchase."
SAMIR MARDA,"Very good to use wireless option mouse, smooth, easy to click & scroll... but no lighting by it’s invisible option...."

Praful,A quality product by Logitech. Came along with a Duracell battery which has a long life. Prompt delivery by Amazon.Overall satisfied with the purchase and delivery experience.
Hemal,I have gone ne through various option on this site and finally choose this product. Logitech is known for durability and this is the one of  best wireless mouse.
Amazon Customer,Good mouse but size is too small. Doesn't fit for men's hands.  Good for girls/women's hands. My fingers were crossing 1 inch in front of mouse and if I try to keep them on buttons then there was no support for palm.Returning  :(
Vinay Rawat,It is a perfect size mouse for me. Ergonomics is great and can be carried anywhere easily.
Avinash,Love this piece. It's a must for all who r looking for quality product. The range is good as well.
Eke,"Better for office use or short work purpose, as it's tiny in size don't think for playing games"
Amazon Customer,Nearly 1 year have been completed and haven't changed the battery. Requires only one battery and has a slot to keep the receiver inside the mouse while not in use for long time. Can be used as ppt slide changing device and works for even a lengthy auditorium. Has invisible light so it does not harm your eyes and it is an energy saving technique.
Sandeep Saksena,Mouse worked perfectly and precision is good. Usb adapter worked without fuss in my laptop and came with a battery already installed. Sizenis compact which I was looking for.
Yahiya,It doesn’t have an indicator. We can’t recognise whether the mouse is on or off until we use it...
Yogesh G.,I have been using it for 3-4 months now. It is working perfectly fine as expected. Amazon's delivery is awesome. You should go for this without a second thought at this price.
Probal Acharyya,"I have been using the product since its delivery and its been 19 days now. Have no complaints so far. Very smooth, swift and also look wise good."
SUBHAM DAS,For any lite and office purpose nothing can be best than this item at this price

RISHI RAJ,The product is highly beneficial if your use is for normal professional stuff or moderate use. For gaming it is okay I can say but try a higher end if you want go for gaming. Overall a value for money and a durable product.
Chaitanya,The mouse is so small compare to the dell Ones. The size of the mouse is same as your palm.
Sagar Dalvi,"Good ProductGood Grip while using.I am using since 3 months.Now Feb 10, 2019 I am writing this note . Bluetooth range is good but Left click is gone, not working properly. so I am going to order Wired Mouse of Logitech or HP, which is reliable and OK."
Sarat Kumar,"Battery life is ok. Build quality is excellent. Logitech devices are known for their durability. Install logitech options software(not included in package, download from official website) for reconfiguration of buttons, sensitivity and more options for mouse."
Vibhav singh,Look wise feel great .. Works fine no issues at all... Buttons are too soft that's nice but sometimes it clicks even a slight touch.. Otherwise perfect for use
Amazon Customer,"It’s a blessing in disguise.Sleek design, very compatible with all devices, long lasting, doesn’t break if fell down. Good product"
Nilesh Attarde,"I have purchased this product 5 months ago and facing issue with scroll and left mouse button.The build quality of the mouse is okay, but the scroll button is not that good. dust can easily damage the scroll button."

Anurag Jain,"One of the Most loveliest Mouse that i have bought, The Ergonomics are perfect & grips created are very nice. The button press creates the sound of ""click click"" which is more of an ODE to the old technology. Simply put don't hesitate in buying it."
npp23,"Easy to use, good lag free connectivity and economic battery usage too. Worth the money!"
vanshika gupta,Great quality compact mouse very sturdy easy to carry n work with love the product also it was delivered with the battery

KM,Like the size - not too small or too big and responsive too
Abhishek Chowdhury,"Good for office use, its smaller than it looks in the picture. Would be uncomfortable for big palms. Not a gaming mouse. Bluetooth works seamlessly."
Adi,"Its a wonderful product! I was about to buy the cheaper ones in the range of Rs.250-Rs.400. Read some reviews and felt its better to spend a bit more and go for a better brand. This product is great and just plugged and started working fine.Best part is about the invisible optics where the mouse doesnt emit light which conserves much battery.Also, kudos to Amazon as it delivered the product in less than 24 hrs and that too to a Tier 2 city! Amazing service!"
Ravi Bagri,Awesome Product....I hope it doesn't disappoints later on also
Sandip Kumar De,Will prefer the other models from Logitech. Very basic.
Amazon Customer,"The mouse lasted for 2 1/2 years with daily use of 8 hours, pretty good for the price"

Hanumantha Rao,Product is less weight an easy to handle. Connects immediately to your PC and one of the best and smooth design it is having.
Koko,Very lovely products since I have purchase this product I am very very happy I will not change the battery from last 4 months it's very very nice product thank you Amazon and thank you Logitech keep making affordable strong product.

SARASWATI TRADERS,"when i received package of printer and mouse. i checked printer but i did not checked mouse.but today when i needed mouse i opened it and there was bluetooth usb was missing. side partition of mouse box  was empty.itsa request from amazon team , kindly replace mouse.thanks"
Shantanu T.,The best wireless mouse I could have bought at this price. Extremely stylish and executive design. Awesome performance. Perfectly designed buttons for the optimum force required to click. Big enough to fit in average sized palms. Very light weight considering the AA battery. Just go for it.
Dilip K.,"Good looking but small in size if we compare to normal wired one. It serves the purpose. So, no issue till now."
suhas sharma,good but look very delicate and can break on if it falls down during use. othewise good product
XYZ,"Smooth, accurate, easy to use, convenient. Error free."
sourabh agrawal,Product is good .But packaging was bad.I thought it will work on not by looking into boz condition
Samrat Raj,"Very good battery life. Using it for more than three months now with the same battery that came with the package. Clicks are fairly silent and accurate, scroll is decent. A little small for people with big hands, not a big issue though. Overall very good performance. Definitely worth buying."
Amazon Customer,"Let's get straight to it:- Packaging was damaged- Tracking is improper. (When your cursor should go vertical only, It leans to the right)- Value for Money? Maybe. Recommended? Nope."
Ann,"It's a good product.It's quite small/flat and doesn't have that hump that we can rest our palms on.But I don't really find it to be a great inconvenience.Also, the mouse came with a battery inside."
Shashismiles,"Does the work that it is meant to. No hazzels for installation. Easy to hold. Single battery; so it's only slightly heavy than normal mouse.No problems yet. It's just been 1 month of use though (Roughly 12-13 hrs/day, 5 days a week). It has a dedicated off switch.Scroll is smooth. Click sound too is just right for me. This has been a good buy for me (Touchwood!)"
Praveen anand,I think this one's the best mouse for daily office use. I have been using this from some time now and it has been simple awesome. The connection establishes almost instantly and the battery backup is at least 8 months
Jayesh Kakkar,Great product its been a year I haven't got any problems....nice and very durable product also the battery which came in it is so good that I haven't changed it and its been a year now ...😊😊😊😊
Rugwed Krupa,"Good mouse. Comfortable use. Quick connection, immediate movement tracking Strong signal distance through walls.  Doesn't break when dropped.I reiterate this, almost three years later. Functioning very well. Battery switched only once."
ABG,"A very basic mouse for work, great for plug and play. Comes with a battery so that's a good plus point."
Anand Jalukar,Plastic quality is little cheap. Easily Brakable. If made in LD plastic would be more sturdy and long lasting.
Akash Patel,"I don't know about battery life, have been using it for a couple of months ago and only. But by build quality and easy of hold, it's very good product."
Md. Ziaul Huq Chaudhury,Just received it yesterday. Works as intended. Good for small hands. Can't complaint much at the price which I got.

Plug & play4. Smoothness = awesomenessCons.1. Botton makes exceptional click noise.To windup everthing is good and I would strongly recommend it to you."
Gaurav Bhagia,"This is second piece i ordered, for my colleague this time, excellent product at great price, works good , no lag no problems at all ..."
Thomag,This is an entry level wireless mouse from Logitech. Easy to hold and use. The mouse comes with an alkaline AA battery.
nimesh garg,mouse is nice. great built quality. mouse is average sized. not too big nor too small. responsive and smooth.But the biggest downside is that it doesnt work on glass table tops which is a thumbs down.
KARAN.SINGH,its excellent for normal use and office workbut it sucks at gaming
Sharath,"Do not buy 'Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse (Black)' and 'Logitech B100 Optical Mouse (Black)'. Both the product, the serial number differs on the product and product box. I was in need of these optical and wireless mouse, and this is what a customer gets. Did not expect this. Not recommend."

Abhijeet Joshi,"Reviewing after regular use of it for more than a month. It is quite lightweight, easy to handle and supple in use.  highly recommended for those who are looking for a quality product with a limited budget."

Hashim Jamal,"I have been using Logitech mice, and this one's the best among them.The size is just fine and fits in the palm."
shammy suvarna,Company product. Works good as usual. This is very good mouse. There is no red light down so your battery last for long. The only disadvantage of this light is you usually forget to switch off mouse after use! Good quality and works well. Got it for around 440 to 460rs

Prashant,"The design of mouse is not good, its not easy to hold."
Amit Kumar,Review in July 2018: Product is worth it and I have been using for only 2 weeks. Only battery part should have been better and charging option should have been provided.Review in July 2019: product stopped working and not sure how to get this fixed.
Ginwala Advanced Farm Equipments Pvt Ltd,Mouse clicking noise can awake a person from deep sleep...its that loud....cheap plastic interior parts.....Mouse is absolutely not for design engineers since its scrolling button is tough to press...Moise works cool for normal usage....
Pinky,Logitech is apples switzerland brand. Owner is switzerland but in the package it is mentioned made in china. I bought it after a lot of research but didn't expect this from amazon.
Abhishek,Highly unreliable device. Stopped working after just 10 days. And it's not really worth carrying this device all the way to the service center to get it repaired or replaced. I don't know how often this happens with this device but my experience has been deeply disappointing.
K Vasantha,Good quality product ..I am now using for more than a year
Sambit Mojumdar,Perfect product.. The Mouse is lightweight & easy to use. Has been using this for 2-3 months now. No complaints till date. responsive on almost all surfaces except clear glass (glass table).

Kausik Nandi,Ok product. Light wt. Good for desktop.
Kvm sanjay,Nice product and prompt delivery by Amazon. 👍🏻

gita,it didn't switch on at all! flimsy light weight and a disgrace to logitech! claims to conform toIDA standards!
Amazon Customer,It is a really good quality mouse which is quite reasonably priced. Really good mouse for surfing and any other work-related tasks. Little smaller than other mice in the same genre but it helps in better grip and usage.
Mukesh Mittal,"Just plugged in and instantly worked.  Mouse movement tracking is very good,  I was able to use it comfortably even over bedsheet.  The USB dongle is also perfect and does not protrude out of laptop, thus you can put your laptop in backpack without removing the dongle. Additional benefit is that it looks smart and is very comfortable to hold.  At this prize this is truly worth every penny"
Amazon Customer,Do mention the make on the site for a better clarification.Product is great though.
sreeharsha,"Logitech is always been one of the best brands in making great mouses and keyboards and this product sure keeps their brand name up in the list.The product is light but it can also be used for gaming,if you have bigs hands it might be small for you to hold"
Amazon Customer,"The click , at times does not go thru. Then, you have to double click"

But overall great product , battery(which came with it) worked for an year exactly and could be brought for rough use design and material is very durable."
varun thota,"This mouse amazing when you first buy just like you get the feel of new product, but as you go on using it the wheel of the mouse to scroll up and down will get spoilt and that's the main drawback which I had experienced."
Shashi,I bought the mouse and it stopped working within two weeks. I tried everything but it didn't start working again. Very disappointing. I will never buy anything from Logitech again and will tell further to not buy.
